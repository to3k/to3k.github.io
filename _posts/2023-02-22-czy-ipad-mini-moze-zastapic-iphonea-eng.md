Sometimes I wake up in the morning and my first thought is "I need to change something". I really like changes in my gear, checking out new solutions, different combinations of devices. Unfortunately, my wallet doesn't like it... 🤷‍♂️😅 One beautiful day, I came up with an idea that I included in the title of this post. A #iPadOnly kind of thing, but where a tablet replaces a phone, not a computer. Currently, I use an _iPhone 13 Pro Max_ equipped with a large 6.7" diagonal screen, but could it be replaced with a device with an even larger screen? The _iPad mini 6_ with an 8.3" screen at first glance looks like it could handle this task! I did some research, I have my conclusions on this topic and I would like to share them in this post.

## Advantages of iPad over iPhone - sounds promising... 🤔

Let's start with what such a change could give me. The first and most obvious is a **larger workspace** (screen), unfortunately at the cost of convenience in wearing pants. Almost a 7-inch _iPhone_ is the maximum I can still comfortably carry in my pants pocket, so I would have to carry an over 8-inch _iPad_ in a different way. Well, it would probably involve the need to transfer certain activities to the _Apple Watch_. Let's just agree that now we take our phone even to the bathroom, so maybe it would be good for me if I left devices other than the watch at home more often and went for a walk with the dog only with headphones in my ears and a podcast playing from the watch.

Another huge advantage would be **access to significantly greater possibilities offered by _iPadOS_** compared to _iOS_. We can talk here about access to applications such as _DaVinci Resolve_, but I am more interested in things like _Split View_ (the ability to split the screen into two parts), _Slide Over_ (an additional tray for side applications that can be accessed at any time without leaving the currently used full-screen application), or how the keyboard works on the iPad - gestures that give access to special characters or even the ease of detaching it from the bottom of the screen and changing it to floating. All of this is not available on _iOS_, so it is also not available on the _iPhone_.

**Apple Pencil support**! For some, it may be completely irrelevant, but for others, it can be a crucial matter. Until recently, I belonged to the first group, assuming that I am not a graphic designer and the Pencil is completely unnecessary for me. In fact, when I had it, I didn't use it at all. However, now I appreciate the possibilities it offers. Even if the user does not plan to draw with it, it can still be used for many other precise tasks. When using the _iPad mini 6_ as a phone, it would be worth having the _Pencil_ with you at all times, but I would definitely not choose to carry it using that magnetic connection. I would need to get a case that has a special slot/handle for it.

**Price-wise it might not be that bad**, because the iPad mini 6, even in the _Cellular_ version, will be much cheaper than my _iPhone 13 Pro Max_. However, I would have to add the accessories that would make the benefits of the iPad make sense. Firstly, the second-generation _Apple Pencil 2_. Secondly, I would have to change my _Apple Watch_ to one with cellular support (_Cellular_). Additionally, a sensible case with a place for the stylus, so as not to rely solely on magnetic mounting. A possible change of the car mount to one for tablets. It would add up a bit and the final result would probably be that the prices would be quite similar, but I still think that the _iPad_ set would be the better choice.

_iPad mini 6_, like all new tablets from Apple, is equipped with a **_USB-C_ port**. This argument in favor of the _iPad_ will probably lose its significance this year, as Apple recently confirmed that the iPhone 15 will be equipped with a port mandated by the European Union. Nevertheless, at the moment, giving up the _iPhone_ in favor of the _iPad_ is the only way to become independent from the _Lightning_ port.

There would definitely be something else and certainly not just one thing, but these four aspects mentioned by me would be enough for me to seriously consider replacing my _iPhone 13 Pro Max_ with an _iPad mini 6_.

## Disadvantages, or rather shortcomings, of iPad compared to iPhone - why it doesn't make sense 😕

Unfortunately, even with an _iPad_ with the "Cellular" function (support for LTE/5G cellular networks), it will not be able to make phone calls or send/receive SMS messages. The only thing that can be done is to make calls through FaceTime or apps like Signal, but there will be a problem because the _iPad_ does not have a speaker that would allow for a phone call by holding it up to the ear, so the only option would be to use speakerphone or headphones. Theoretically, this problem could be bypassed with apps like Skype, where you can purchase access to a solution with a normal phone number. I know that people also use Google Voice, but this is an option that only works in the USA.

_iPad_ **cannot be used for contactless payments** with _Apple Pay_. This is not a hopeless situation, as I always have my _Apple Watch_ on hand, which can easily make such payments. Nevertheless, it is a matter worth considering.

There's no point in hiding the fact that the cameras in any _iPad_ don't even come close to those available in _iPhones_, especially in the _Pro Max_ line. In my _iPhone 13 Pro Max_, I have a macro lens (for close-up photos), a telephoto lens (wide-angle), and the ability to zoom three times optically (hardware zoom). In the _iPad mini 6_, we have one poor lens that basically does what it can, but the effect cannot be compared. Of course, it's not that the _iPad_ takes terrible photos, they're just more limited in terms of hardware. _Apple_ is just known for enhancing photos in post-production with appropriate software modifications.

While both the _iPad mini 6_ and _iPhone 13 Pro Max_ are powered by the same processor, unfortunately the _iPad_ only has 4GB of operating memory (RAM) compared to the 6GB in the _iPhone_. Interestingly, while in my opinion 4GB of RAM in a phone is usually sufficient, in a tablet 4GB is definitely not enough. I learned this the hard way when using a regular _iPad 9th generation_ with only 3GB of memory before purchasing the _iPad Air 5 with M1_. It struggled to keep up, making multitasking impossible, which is a key requirement for a tablet.

The argument that has pushed me over the edge is the **lack of _CarPlay_** on _iPad_. Even in my _Ford Focus_, I have a special dongle that allows me to use _CarPlay_ wirelessly. If I couldn't use it, it would be a tragedy for me, so I would have to come up with some workaround, like always carrying an old _iPhone_ in the car. But is that the direction we're going in with these considerations? Is the goal to forcibly prove that using an _iPad_ as a replacement for a phone is possible? Probably not, and at some point, we have to say "enough, it's not possible, stop the train, I'm getting off." For me, this is that moment.

## Mission aborted, but... 😎

I think I have proved to myself that replacing my _iPhone 13 Pro Max_ with an _iPad mini 6_ is not possible and/or will not work in the long run. So what did I do? I bought a used _iPad mini 5_! 😂 I did it to see how this type of device would perform in my daily routine. It didn't cost me much, as I paid 1200 PLN (less than $300) for the basic version (Wi-Fi and 64GB memory). I am writing this text on Saturday and it will probably be published on Wednesday, and I expect the _iPad_ to arrive on Tuesday, so by the time this post is published, I will probably be clicking on it. I won't hesitate to share my impressions!
