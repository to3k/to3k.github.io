[🇵🇱 Przejdź do polskiej wersji tego wpisu / Go to polish version of this post](https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/writefreely-polska/)

It all started with me obtaining the domain [_writefreely.pl_](https://writefreely.pl). Having such a domain, it would be a sin not to use it! So, I launched a free server in the _Oracle Free Tier_ cloud (as described in [this post](https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/oracle-free-tier-eng/)), installed the _YunoHost_ system on it (as described in [this post](https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/yunohost-oracle-eng/)), and launched an instance of _[WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/)_, a maximally simplified blogging platform based on the _ActivityPub_ protocol, which allows for federating with the entire decentralized _Fediverse_.

This post is first and foremost an **invitation to create a free account on _WriteFreely Polska_** and a place where I will briefly **describe this project**. Secondly, it is an introduction, or rather a teaser, of a post in which I will describe how to launch your own instance of _WriteFreely_ on _YunoHost_.

## How to get access?

Right from the start, I would like to emphasize that this **instance is free and available to everyone**. As its creator, I do not derive any financial benefits from its operation. However, I bear all the costs associated with running this instance. Fortunately, at the moment, this is only the cost of the domain, because I don't pay anything for the server yet, and the rest is just the potential cost of my free time. Of course, there is a possibility of supporting me financially, but [more on that later](#wsparcie).

Due to concerns about spam and malicious actors, I have decided to disable a completely open registration system. _WriteFreely_ is not secure against bots, and requiring only a username and password during registration (without any additional verification) makes it vulnerable to attacks from them. Instead, to be able to register an account, you need to use a special invitation, which can be accessed via the button below:

[**https://writefreely.pl/invite/45BrVb**](https://writefreely.pl/invite/45BrVb)

Using this invitation, every user can also invite friends. This invitation has no quantitative limits and is not time-restricted. After clicking on the link, you will be redirected to a page where you can create your account. All you need is a username and password. It is also possible to provide an email address, but it is not required in any way. It is important to emphasize that with this approach, if you lose/forget your password, you will lose access to your account without the possibility of resetting or recovering it in any other way. This is the policy of the _WriteFreely_ platform creators, and not mine, although I fully understand such an approach because one of the main principles of this platform is simplicity and care for users' privacy, and therefore, requiring only necessary information for the blog to operate.

## What does it look like?

As I mentioned before, _WriteFreely_ is characterized by simplicity both in terms of use and the appearance of the entire platform. The creators clearly focused on minimalism, which is undoubtedly a plus for both writers and readers. All of this is also combined with full integration with the _ActivityPub_ protocol, and thus the entire _Fediverse_.

Blogs created on the _WriteFreely Polska_ _instance_ are available at the following addresses:

> https://writefreely.pl/<username>

In my case, it is: [https://writefreely.pl/to3k](https://writefreely.pl/to3k). And the first test post that I wrote can be read here: [https://writefreely.pl/to3k/witaj-na-writefreely-polska](https://writefreely.pl/to3k/witaj-na-writefreely-polska). I encourage you to visit and see what it looks like in practice.

After creating an account for our blog, we also receive a kind of profile in the _instance_ that can be accessed by anyone through all federated services within the _Fediverse_. To find this profile, you can enter the appropriate _handle_ (username) from your _Mastodon_ account's search bar, for example:

> @<username>@writefreely.pl

In the case of my blog, it would be _@to3k@writefreely.pl_. Try entering it in the search bar of your _Mastodon_ account, and you will receive a result similar to the one below.
