Today, another post from the series of short posts. Its creation was caused by something very interesting that I came across! Someone smart has created a _Shortcut_ on _iOS_, which implemented a communication system with _ChatGPT_ through an _API_. In this way, you can always have the possibility to ask a quick question to artificial intelligence at your fingertips, with just one button press.

## Quick installation guide

1. Download and install the _S-GPT Encoder_ helper shortcut: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b66b86615b0b478bad95948616e4f48a](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b66b86615b0b478bad95948616e4f48a)

3. Create an account on the _OpenAI_ website and obtain a free _API_ key (starting with a free account gives you $5, which is enough for a long time with not too intensive use): [https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup/](https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup/)

5. Download and install the _S-GPT_ target shortcut: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/882c9a2870c0431098905445a5f1511e](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/882c9a2870c0431098905445a5f1511e)

7. Upon its first run, it will ask for the _OpenAI_ _API_ key. You can also enter it later in the shortcut properties \[1\].

9. After entering the first prompt, you will be asked for permission to use the second shortcut (the helper) and to communicate with the _OpenAI_ server. For convenience, I recommend clicking Always Allow in both cases.

11. If someone has access to GPT-4, he/she can change the model in the shortcut properties \[2\].
